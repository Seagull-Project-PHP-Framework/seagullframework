Seagull FCKeditor

This is Version 2.2 of FCKeditor (2005/12/23)

We removed some unused stuff, e.g. translations, themes, smileys, asp support...

Feel free to update from www.fckeditor.net if you need anything else.

  * If you want to add an additional translation be sure to add it in 
    editor/lang/fcklanguagemanager.js
  * all configuration should be done in <sgl-root>/www/js/SglFckconfig.js

For integrating a new version please look at:
