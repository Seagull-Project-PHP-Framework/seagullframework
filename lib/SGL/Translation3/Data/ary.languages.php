     * All the supported languages have to be listed in the array below.
     * 1. The key must be the "official" ISO 639 language code and, if required,
     *    the dialect code. It can also contain some informations about the
     *    charset (see the Russian case).
     * 2. The first of the values associated to the key is used in a regular
     *    expression to find some keywords corresponding to the language inside two
     *    environment variables.
     *    These values contains:
     *    - the "official" ISO language code and, if required, the dialect code
     *      also ('bu' for Bulgarian, 'fr([-_][[:alpha:]]{2})?' for all French
     *      dialects, 'zh[-_]tw' for Chinese traditional...);
     *    - the '|' character (it means 'OR');
     *    - the full language name.
     * 3. The second values associated to the key is the name of the file to load
     *    without the 'inc.php' extension.
     * 4. The last values associated to the key is the language code as defined by
     *    the RFC1766.
     *
     * Beware that the sorting order (first values associated to keys by
     * alphabetical reverse order in the array) is important: 'zh-tw' (chinese
     * traditional) must be detected before 'zh' (chinese simplified) for
     * example.
     *
     * When there are more than one charset for a language, we put the -utf-8
     * first.
     *
     * For Russian, we put 1251 first, because MSIE does not accept 866
     * and users would not see anything.
