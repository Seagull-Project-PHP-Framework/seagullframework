-- The schema in mysql.fk.fix.sql will load user related tables with correct FK constraints
-- however mysql 4.0.x and 4.1.x seem to have a bug where deleting a record with a child
-- constraint gives an FK violation error.  The correct behaviour is when a user record
-- is deleted where usr_id = 2, all related records from user_permission and user_preference
-- should also be deleted on the cascade.  MySQL appears to misinterpret this and will only
-- delete the user record when wrapped in SET_FOREIGN_KEY_CHECK=0 calls.  Not surprisingly,
-- this disables the cascade behaviour defeating the original purpose of using cascades.
--
-- Unless someone discovers a workaround, FK integrity will be abandoned in the MySQL version
-- until this bug is fixed.
