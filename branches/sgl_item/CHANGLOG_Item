Changelog for sgl_item branch
FIXME: Make publisher module to be installed automatically on installation / rebuild sgl


2006-08-24: Merge from private svn repro
    * SGL_Item::retrievePaginated() has now a search filter and is more configurable (Werner Krauss)
    * item can belong to multiple categories (Werner Krauss)
    * merged ContentTypeMgr add and edit templates
FIXME: move to admin theme!
    * ContentTypeMgr: added new fieldtype: datetime (Werner Krauss)
 	* Updated Schema and Demo Data
 	* Item fields have a flag if they are translateable or not. This means a 
 	  field can automatically have the same value for all languages (Werner Krauss)
FIXME: no GUI implementation yet
FIXME: changing this flag in running system causes problems with existing data
 	* Added some helper methods, e.g. usesWysiwyg() to determine if wysiwyg editor is
 	  needed for the current item. Useful in ArticleMgr::Add() and Edit() (Werner Krauss)
 	* ContentTypeMgr: added new field type: YesNo, a boolean radio pair (Werner Krauss)
