CHANGELOG
=========
+-----------------------+
| VERSION: 0.5.3        |
+-----------------------+
BUGFIXES

            (Werner Krauss)
31-10-05	Fixed broken config calls in templates
26-10-05    Registration emails are no longer CCed to admin, separate notification
            is sent.

IMPROVEMENTS
10-11-05    Moved all SQL data to respective modules (modules, perms, role_perm
            assignments) by creating an auto-increment token in data and using
            dynamic inserts
09-11-05    Added ability for sql parser to auto-increment records when PK is marked
            with {SGL_NEXT_ID} token
09-11-05    Added ability to add all or minimum modules
09-11-05    Added ability to remove frontScriptName and have even clearner urls than
            previously, eg, now available: http://example.com/user/login/
            Option currently only available to apache users with mod_rewrite enabled,
            to activate set [site][frontScriptName] = false and copy
            seagull/etc/htaccess-cleanUrl.dist to seagull/www/.htaccess and make sure
            the file is readable by the webserver (Julien Casanova)
09-11-05    Added ability to backdate articles (Werner Krauss)
09-11-05    Removed unnecessary framebuster from login page

06-11-05    Moved all core classes that doubled up with other classes to reduce
            file loading to seagull/lib/SGL/Other.php.  Currently this contains
            SGL_Array, SGL_Date and SGL_Inflector.  Should make libs easier to find:
            if you don't see a file named the same as the lib you want, it will most
            likely be in Other.php
04-11-05    New wizard can only be accessed if admin knows password stored in
            seagull/var/INSTALL_COMPLETE.php.  Installer is invoked automatically
            on first seagull install, and can be called manually by calling setup.php

            CategoryMgr so core modules could work

            'default' module as that's what they are, default

03-11-05    category table and data moved to publisher
