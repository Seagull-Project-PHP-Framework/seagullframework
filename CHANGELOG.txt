13-10-04    Made authentication optional which eases debugging (see Config)

                    'unassigned' role
                -   removing all user perms associated with the role
25-09-04    Flexy's 'globalfunctions' is now correctly implemented by default
            so you can call PHP functions from the templates. See 
                seagull/www/themes/default/maintenance/langEdit.html for eg
            (beltspeed@shaw.ca)
24-09-04    SGL_Output::dateArray2String fix (Werner M. Krauss)
23-09-04    makeUrl no longer perpetuates existing action param, this was 
            leading to unexpected URLs
21-09-04    The makeUrl() method in Output (for use when search-engine-friendly 
            URLs are enabled) now takes the format:
                {makeUrl(#actionName#,#managerName#,#moduleName#)}frmParamName/frmParamValue
            note the absence of a / after the method call - this gets around
            an issue when using Zend debugger the last querystring param
            was being altered by the auto-appended 
                ?start_debug=1&debug_port=10000&debug_host=127.0.0.1
                &send_sess_end=1&debug_no_cache=1095852384295&debug_stop=1
                &debug_url=1&debug_new_session=1
21-09-04    Setup wizard (dbBootstrap.php) now registers connection details
            even when schema is not created / better error handling

            (AJ Tarachanowicz)
17-09-04    Moved blocks to z-index: 1 so footer doesn't overlap vertical

            problems with unserializing objects from session (luis@awarez.net)
17-09-04    Added ability for search engine friendly URLs to parse GET arrays.  
            PHP's 'magic' functionality that converts 
                <input name="user[password]">
            into $user['password'] is not available when you parse 
            $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] (michael@awarez.net)
17-09-04    Fixed bug in Output::generateSelect() where ('status' == 0) 
            evaluates to true:
                var_dump('status');
                string(6) "status"

                var_dump(0);
                int(0)

                var_dump('status' == 0); 
                bool(true) /* ? */
            (luis@awarez.net)

            patch to SGL::logMessage you can now pass a much simpler call the 
            logger to register that your method was invoked.  Additionally, 
            setting the SGL_DEBUG_SHOW_LINE_NUMBERS constant to true you can get 
            file and line number info.  The change is BC with the previous
            format (andrew@awarez.net)

IMPROVEMENTS
31-05-04    Czech translation added (Petr Votocek)
31-05-04    Improved module management (Michaï¿½l Willemot)
28-05-04    Modified SGL_Manager so it's properly abstract, will make it an
            interface when PHP5 compat happens
28-05-04    Added reverse sorting to guestbook and pagination (Michaï¿½l Willemot)
27-05-04    Added error msg for missing images requested from doc mgr

            ssl and non-ssl http connections.  also removed the 'baseUrl' 
            key from config and am determining it dynamically instead, see code 
            in init.php for details. 
23-05-04    Enabled ability to run partially completed themes, which
            is a feature of Flexy, so if you want to make your own theme,
            just copy the 'default' theme directory, and remove everything
            except for 'images' and 'css' whose contents you will modify.
            Then, if you modify the 'default' module's templates in your 
            new theme, eg, banner, header and footer, these will override
            the default versions but leave the rest of the body content
            untouched.  In other words, it's quite a quick and easy process
            to create a new look & feel.
23-05-04    Cleaned up directory structure as agreed on mailing list, it
            now looks something like this:

            - moved errorhandler stuff to _SGL
            - moved dataobject init to init.php
            - moved $conf into _SGL only
            ===============
            from now on use:
                $conf = & $GLOBALS['_SGL']['CONF'];
            instead of:
                global $conf;
            ===============

24-03-04    Fixed bug in profile editing
24-03-04    Fixed bug where static articles were incorrectly showing related 
            content
23-03-04    Fixed bug that incorrectly showed current article as 'related' 
            article too
18-03-04    Interestingly a bug crept into the FileMgr functionality whereby
            requesting to view files with a text/plain mime type incorrectly
            prompted a download in MSIE 6 (with the latest patches) - I'm 
            guessing MS has changed the functionality as I haven't changed the 
            code and it used to work fine for the past year or so.  The fix 
            included adding an additional header which forces the 
            Content-Disposition to 'inline'.
16-03-04    Fixed typo for 'current category'
25-02-04    Fixed block_id error (AJ Tarachanowicz)

IMPROVEMENTS
26-04-04    Nav code abstracted out of Controller and loaded as a default driver
25-04-04    Util::cache* removed as they overlapped with Cache_Lite 
            functionality
24-04-04    Added descriptions for the modules.
21-04-04    Applied Michaï¿½l Willemot's improvement for module listing, data now
            in DB instead of ini file
20-04-04    Various performance improvements resulting from only loading DataObject
            when required, up to  60% faster in some cases
14-04-04    Applied Radek's patch, date handling improved/simplified with PEAR

            of adding dynamic or static pages.
06-04-04    Big schema reoganisation, all table primary keys conform to a 
            tablename_id format, with indexes and referential integrity (thanks 
            Radek Maciaszek)
05-04-04    Adapted raw query LIMIT style to be Postgresql compatible (thanks 
            Pierpaolo Toniolo)
31-03-04    Cache manager added to maintenance module
29-03-04    Articles navigation widget now correctly manages permissions
            for public as well logged in users.  This means you can create
            articles and documents that can be hidden from the public and only
            displayed to authenticated users.  Please note that while a user can 
            pass an category ID as a URL parameter and access a forbidden 
            category name, s/he will not be able to see any articles/documents 
            within it.
29-03-04    Updated PEAR libs html_css, html_quickform, xml_rpc, validate and 
            db_nestedset
29-03-04    Added dataobject entity generator to the maintenance module 
            (Gerry Lachac)
29-03-04    Last selected module now remembered in session, makes updates easier
28-03-04    Created new maintenance module for basic framework housekeeping 
            tasks
25-03-04    Removed open_basedir = SGL_PATH recommendation as Rasmus says it's a
            real performance killer
24-03-04    New Italian translation added (thanks Pierpaolo Toniolo)
24-03-04    Thanks to Pierpaolo Toniolo for an updated postgres schema
23-03-04    The safe delete feature for articles is now configurable, if
            you set it to false (/app/modules/publisher/conf.ini) articles
            are wiped from the DB; if not, their status is only set to zero,
            in other words, a safe delete.
22-03-04    Added a LanguageMgr class which provides tools to manage 
            translations and language files.  You can diff translated files 
            against English masters, add missing definitions, and/or edit 
            existing translations.
18-03-04    Added new wizard (multi-page form) functionality, see the README.txt
            in the wizardExample folder in /app/modules
17-03-04    Improved Output::showDateSelector method to give future and 
            historical date ranges
17-03-04    Reinstated permissions for Publisher
16-03-04    Moved htmlArea js to mainAdmin.js so it's not called on every page
16-03-04    You can now use admin's Configuration tab to switch between SQL and 
            file logging in one easy step
16-03-04    Renamed 'table_locks' table to 'table_lock' for consistency
16-03-04    Renamed 'sequences' table to 'sequence' for consistency
16-03-04    Added dynamic language selection sample page
16-03-04    New Russian translation added (thanks Ilya Nemihin)
15-03-04    Improved handling of language files and character sets, current 
            system is similar to phpMyAdmin
11-03-04    New Chinese translations added, Simplified and Traditional (thanks 
            Henry Juan)
02-03-04    New German translation added (thanks Werner M. Krauss)
02-03-04    Hard-coded lang strings removed from majority of templates and into 
            language files (thanks Werner M. Krauss)
01-03-04    Added new open source LGPL-licensed icons to represent modules
16-02-04    Added a new interface, Wizard, so all classes implementing this instead
            of Manager can easily create multipage wizard functionality
15-02-04    Moved language arrays out of /app/data and into relevant lang files
15-02-04    Manager and Output cleanup: Mananger now only has methods
            pertinent to its subclasses; removed unnecessary vars from Output;
            Factored extra methods into new PublisherBase class
15-02-04    Changed default charset from iso-8859-1 to iso-8859-15 to allow
            for euro character (Werner M. Krauss)
14-02-04    Incorporated Andy's big CSS fix so now menus are generated
            as html lists and transformed into either 2 level tabs or 
            dropdowns by selected stylesheet.  This is one big step towards
            XHTML compliance, reducing page size and using latest CSS
            standards to control look and feel. 
12-02-04    Big cleanup which basically got rid of long case statements in 
            process methods and replaced them with the newer, 
            if (method_exists()) syntax that checks against the class var 
            $_aAllowedActions.
10-02-04    Preferences system added: admin can alter default pref values, 
            add/remove new ones; registered users can alter their preferences, 
            values carred in session and persisted in DB
01-02-04    Dynamic navigation extended to admin section
01-02-04    Made ini_{set|get}s optional so Seagull can run when PHP has safe 
            mode enabled, ie, in a shared hosting environment
31-01-04    Changed all template function calls from old {t.funcName(arg)} to 
            Flexy's new {funcName(arg)} format
31-01-04    Removed all occurences of stripslashes in templates and code as
            this is implicitly handled by Request
31-01-04    Fewer confirmations for publishing articles
31-01-04    Further improvements to Request handling, auto-stripping of html
            and javascript, whitespace, magic_quotes_gpc
31-01-04    Made input censoring functionality easier to use
24-01-04    Upgraded to latest Flexy, DB_DataObject, DB and PEAR
21-01-04    Simplified calling of $conf var from 
                $conf = & $GLOBALS['_SGL']['CONF'] 
            to
                global $conf;
21-01-04    Added P3P privacy policy support
21-01-04    Created web GUI for modifying config values
21-01-04    Modified default logfile path in *.conf.ini from c:/msys/1.0/home/..
            to correct location, ie seagull/logs/php_log.txt
19-01-04    Updated PEAR libs: Net_URL, Log
19-01-04    See Output::msgSet() for global Seagull error-checking, similar to 
            PEAR's errorPop()
19-01-04    Changed to using divs for outputing the wrapping list of modules
19-01-04    Relicensed core framework files to BSD for greater flexibility
16-01-04    Renamed sql data files to bring them more into line with config file 
            naming.  'default' is instead of 'minimal' and 'extended' has become
            'sample', as in sample application.
16-01-04    Changed method of locating main app-wide config file, now 
            SERVER_NAME is queried and the appropriate conf file is loaded.
            This way it is not necessary to modify the init.php file when 
            uploading your code to a live server.  The naming convention for
            the file is <hostname>.<type>.conf.ini this way you can run various
            conf files for the same host, ie default, optimised, debug, etc.
            Support is also included for virtual hosts running on ports other 
            than 80, such as localhost_8080.default.conf.ini
15-01-04    Upgraded to latest version of Log
15-01-04    Removed html admin nav from Controller
15-01-04    Cleaned up Session class, security improved, IP check removed from 
            fingerprint since it doesn't work with AOL, proxies, etc
13-01-04    Made Request more efficient
13-01-04    Removed SGL::importGlobalVariable
01-01-04    Moved css files to their own subdir

KNOWN ISSUES
08-04-04    Navigation Style Mgr does not seem to work reliably in Mozilla

BUGFIXES
23-12-03    Login forgot passwd field too short (Mark Sudbury)
05-12-03    Renamed 'password' db field to 'passwd' because it was a reserved
            word
04-12-03    Fixed bug where session expiry was being missed
30-11-03    PEAR errors were not being written to the browser, only logs,
            this now works as expected when $conf['debug']['production'] is
            false
11-11-03    Fixed some nasty notices when users who had no email tried to
            view messages

IMPROVEMENTS
01-01-04    A polish translation has been started by Radek Maciaszek 
            <radek@maciaszek.pl>
23-12-03    A new XHTML skin is available (basic-css) which is very close to
            validating, a few more Coolmenu glitches to work out (John Dell)
20-12-03    Updated following PEAR libs: http, http_header, date, config, log, 
            xml_util, html_quickform, html_treemenu, pear, validate, date, 
            console_getopt
18-12-03    Base class no longer unneccesarily inherits from PEAR (thanks Davey)
            nor Controller from Base.  Also removed unneccesary parent 
            constructor firing
13-12-03    Cleaned up failed DB connect error msgs
12-12-03    Added debug info to logged PEAR error messages
11-12-03    You no longer have to open a new database connection when requesting a
            nextId() to insert a dataObject.  Old instances of 
                $dbh = & SGL_DB::singleton();
            can now be replaced with the cleaner:
                $dbh = $dataObject->getDatabaseConnection();
11-12-03    Thanks to Alan Knowles <alan@akbkhome.com> for incorporating a patch 
            into Flexy which allows multiple paths to be searched for templates.  
            With these changes please now do all your template includes 
            according to the following format:
                <flexy:include src="myTemplate.html" />
09-12-03    Andy Crain created a new Navigation Style Manager which provides a 
            web form to customise the look&feel of CoolMenu dHtml dropdowns
09-12-03    Stylesheets more customisable and are cached by PHP, thanks to
            John Dell <jdell@unr.edu>
02-12-03    Updated login form to be more user-friendly (John Dell)
01-12-03    Errors are now location-specific, ie the error is printed out
            in the brower where it occurs, a la Quickform
01-12-03    Added the ability to create themes/skins
01-12-03    Cleaned up LoginMgr and separated out password-related functionality
            into a new PasswordMgr class.
01-12-03    Incorporated Andy Crain's new Navigation Manager which makes
            excellent use of DB_NestedSet and the custom CoolMenus driver
            he wrote for it.  Updated schema accordingly.
01-12-03    Started replacing long switch/case action statements with a more
            efficient if (method_exists($method)) approach, see 
            UserMgr::process() for example.  Added 'allowed methods' array to 
            check against (Gilles Laborderie).  Original idea from a post by 
            Alan Knowles.
01-12-03    Sending error/status messages is now simplified, previous message
            'tokens' have been removed from GET and now message is stored in 
            session and retrieved on target page, with Output::msgSet and msgSet
            respectively.  This change allowed for the removal of the large and
            ugly showMsg method from Output, and consolidates all translations
            in the language files.  Thanks to Simon Willison for the idea:
            http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/11/22/statusNotification
            All message/notifications are now broken up into two types, usually
            delivered together:
            1. general notification message (one per page), eg: "please fill in all
               required fields"
            2. field-specific error messages (as many as required)
            I hope to be able to reproduce quickform's pretty 'error next to 
            relevant field' effect shortly.
30-11-03    The Controller::initPage() method is now public, this makes it
            possible to initialise the framework without having to go through
            the validate/process/display workflow, something very handy for
            the logout functionality
30-11-03    Controller processing now broken up into discreet methods,
            should make page logic clearer
28-11-03    All 'delete' buttons now appear at bottom of admin screens
27-11-03    Check out Alan's example file, /etc/flexyExample.htm for insight
            on how to use Flexy templates
23-11-03    Removed Quickform from all user management screens for performance
            reasons
23-11-03    Passwords finally one-way encrypted with md5.  So we now have new
            'retrieve password' functionality, users get their passwords reset
            when they correctly enter their email address, security question
            and answer.  Admin can now also reset passwords and optionally 
            notify users
23-11-03    In order to modify the admin password, just run md5 from the 
            command line against the clear-text passwd of your choice, and
            paste it into the db:
                php -r "print md5('admin');"

KNOWN ISSUES
02-01-04    After modifying categories in admin the structure is not modified in
            the front end: simply delete nav.dat and categories.dat in the 
            /app/tmp directory
02-01-04    An 'element already exists' error appears when trying to edit an
            existing block: this is being worked on
02-01-04    Reording and inserting levels in the Navigation Manager is 
            unreliable: this is also being worked on
02-01-04    Navigation Style Manager preview does not reflect Coolmenu choice:
            being worked on

+-----------------------+

BUGFIXES
11-11-03    Added PEAR's Log constants so when logging is disabled notices are
            not raised
11-11-03    Fixed bug with FAQ manager where inserting a new FAQ incorrectly 
            returned an error, this is because DO expects sequences/auto_increment
            and the default functionality is overriden in mysql driver
11-11-03    Changed all PSG_ references to SGL_
09-11-03    Fixed bug where Flesch score was not correctly referenced in Publisher
09-11-03    ErrorHandler class now correctly ignores expressions prefixed with
            the @ operator (Gilles Laborderie)


IMPROVEMENTS
18-11-03    Updated pear libs to latest Quickform, HTML_Common, DB_DataObject
            and Log
09-11-03    Blocks look & feel abstracted to stylesheet.  The styles are 
            used by default although they can be overriden by calling 
            user-defined styles from the 'block' table
09-11-03    Previous 'debug' mode now enabled by default if Seagull is setup 
            in development mode, with E_ALL errors fed back to the browser
09-11-03    Simplified init.php file, now only 1 line needs to be configured,
            all other settings moved to /etc/{dev|live}.ini files
09-11-03    Added switch in /etc/{dev|live}.ini to enable code profiling if 
            xDebug installed
09-11-03    Removed additional notices
09-11-03    Updated navigation and block cacheing to be configurable, 
            see /etc/{dev|live}.ini, easier to develop with caching disabled
09-11-03    Moved 'module' mgr to 'default' module
08-11-03    Updated HTTP_Request and Cache_Lite libs
07-11-03    Created additional schemas for Oracle and MS SQL
07-11-03    Created sql migration scripts for MySQL
29-10-03    Made following alterations to schema for pg compatibility
            - separated schemas from data
            - removed all 'unsigned'
            - changed all 'tinyint' to 'smallint'
            - removed backticks enclosing column names
            - made all column names lowercase, words separated by _, removed
              _fk suffixes
            - replaced sequence table with pg sequences
            NB: dhtml nav widget for articles won't work with pgsql
                as it's dependent on mysql in HTML_TreeMenu

KNOWN ISSUES
19-11-03    Please set allow_call_time_pass_reference = On in your php.ini, this
            will overcome notice errors in the nav widget when you go into
            publisher.  The errors occur in Tree class, the author will be 
            contacted.

            nested tags

28-10-03    Added the ini setting allow_url_fopen and set it to false, this can
            avoid some nasty hacks
27-10-03    The Request::get method has been changed so it strips any PHP/HTML
            tags by default, thus minimising XSS attacks.  If you wish to accept 
            html from the request, pass a true argument as the optional second 
            parameter like so:
                $input->body = $req->get('frmBody', true);
            In the case that html is allowed, javascript is stripped from the
            string
27-10-03    Example usage of improving form security with one-time tokens, see
            /modules/contactus/classes/ContactUsMgr.php lines 66-73 and display
            method for details
26-10-03    Cleaned up date functions in Output
20-10-03    Thanks to Thomas Moulard <thomas.moulard@wanadoo.fr> for improving 
            the install script, it now works well provided you're installing on
            a *nix based machine and have root
17-10-03    Incorporated Andy's navigation cacheing, big performance improvement
            <apcrain@fuse.net>
17-10-03    Cleaned up error codes
17-10-03    Made cookie settings more configurable in init.php

KNOWN ISSUES
26-10-03    There is an incompatibility with DB_DataObject and MMcache.  You can
            fix this by modifying line 316 of DataObject.php from:
                $this->_build_condition($this->table()) ; 
            to
                $tbl = $this->table(); $this->_build_condition($tbl);

            timeouts (Andy Crain)
13-10-03    Fixed upload problem in docMgr that resulted from new input
            filtering in Request::get() (alexmartin)

IMPROVEMENTS
15-10-03    Additional error types added (init.php), all raised errors assigned
            types in 2nd arg
15-10-03    Added cacheing for blocks (thanks to Andy Crain <apcrain@fuse.net>)
            Remember that for admin changes to be reflected in front end, admins 
            must first logout which fires an 'empty cache' event
14-10-03    Removed notices from Controller and SimpleNav
14-10-03    Added BC support for PHP versions < 4.2.0 in init.php
13-10-03    Added months array in French (Thomas Moulard)

            (thanks to Andy Crain <apcrain@fuse.net>)
13-10-03    Added configurable charset meta tag as per 
            http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html
            update: commented out as this broke accented chars, any 
            ideas?
10-10-03    Latest Flexy class integrated at last!  This means:
            - no more <?= short tags
            - coding to E_ALL is possible
            - update.php no longer required, pages work like old-style .jsp in 
              the sense that the first time the webserver receives a request 
              for them, they compile, after which requests are much quicker
            For seasoned Seagull developers, pls watch out for the following
            gotchas:
            - unless you want to take advantage of Flexys forms features, make
              sure your forms contain the 'flexy:ignore' element:
              <form name="login" method="POST" action="login.php" flexy:ignore>
            - anywhere you had {o.varName} it's now {varName}
            - if your using a foreach to loop over a SINGLE <tr> you can 
              now get rid of the old:
                {foreach:results,key,valueObj}
              and replace it with the much sexier:
                <tr flexy:foreach="results,key,valueObj">
            - there are two types of includes: 
              (1) is for the global banner.html and footer.html templates, and 
              indeed anything in the default tmpl folder: 
                {t.psg_include(#adminBanner.html#)}
              (2) to pick up includes in your current module's tmpl dir, use
                {include(#template.html#)}
            - in the next release, includes will be consolidated in the form:
              <flexy:include src="xxx.html"/>, this is still under dev on Flexy
              in CVS
            - there are also great ways of displaying conditional errors, see
              Flexy docs at pear.php.net, it does many things currently taken
              care of by QuickForm
            - if you get any errors after changing a template, try deleting
              and recompiling
            - watch out for incorrectly nested html tags, these can invalidate
              template vars
            - the file /lib/pear/HTML/Template/Flexy/Compiler/Standard/Functions.php
              has a call to the constant __CLASS__ in it which works only in PHP 4.3+
              so I've added a pretty crude hack to the file to get around this
10-10-03    Moved most javascript into external .js files
09-10-03    Upgraded to latest HTML_TreeMenu, class overriden for custom
            behaviour.  Tried to integrate Wolfram's Tree class (instead of the
            current R. Hayes Tree class) which has the advantage that it is part 
            of the PEAR library and makes most of categoryMgr redundant.  
            However with Wolfram's class I cannot get the graphic icons working
            nor the hrefs.  Lately the most actively maintained tree lib seems
            to be NestedSet - any ideas?
09-10-03    Thomas Moulard <thomas.moulard@wanadoo.fr> contributed French 
            translations for all the modules!

KNOWN ISSUES  
16-10-03    Block manager does not successfully clean up old assignments
15-10-03    Cache_lite give a warning error first time to a page, this should
            only show up in the logs in the default setup
15-10-03    The cookieless implementation currently doesn't work
15-10-03    Install script, setupSGL.sh, is still not working properly

29-09-03    Fixed bug where sort graphics were of incorrect case (Oscar Porcar)
25-09-03    Fixed email template bug with Contact Us module
25-09-03    Fixed incorrect page redirect in Contact Us module


IMPROVEMENTS
01-10-03    Removed persistent connect (again) as it's been reported many times
            to cause problems with MySQL (change in SGL::DB):
            http://news.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.dev&article=22271
01-10-03    Improved the Explorer2 driver for MenuBuilder: dhtml for menu
            moved from session to a cache file, and SID only appended if
            cookies are disabled
01-10-03    Cleaned up stylesheet and converted remaining tabs to spaces
01-10-03    Removed if (!defined(SGL_MANAGER_CLASS_CALLED)) stuff which is no
            longer required
01-10-03    Global detection of magic quotes, and removal of backslashes if 
            magic_quotes_gpc is enabled, which it is by default.  Therefore any 
            user input value received from Request::get() will have leading and 
            trailing whitespace removed (see trim entry below), and will have 
            PHP's automatic magic quoting, ie, backslashes before ' and ", 
            removed so the developer gets 'clean' data.  Basically, reference 
            this post by A. Knowles, 
            http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=pear-general&m=106100849229394&w=2
            DB_DataObject will automatically escape values passed to it before
            performing any query, avoiding security issues.  Be wary, though, 
            if you are performing a query using PEAR::DB and are unsure if your 
            data needs to be escaped, always sanitise it with DB::quote($var) 
            first.  See /core/Request
01-10-03    Global trim() of user input data added
01-10-03    Experiemental Util::cleanInput introduced in LoginMgr. See 
            /core/Request, above two points describe how whitespace and slashes
            are removed, Util::cleanInput additionally removes HTML tags and any 
            further whitespace that is revealed in the process.  Please see 
            forum posting for how this can be improved:
            http://forum.phpkitchen.com/viewtopic.php?p=169#169
            Ideally I would like to have the static method handle the 4 
            scenarios described in the post, a given scenario would be specified
            by passing it as a constant parameter.
01-10-03    is_a BC hack moved from VFS for easier upgrades
01-10-03    Utils class not required by default, you must call on an as-needs 
            basis, for performance
01-10-03    Fixed inefficient building of article collections
25-09-03    Added appropriate error message to Contact Us in case of fail
25-09-03    Improved Request class to automatically remove whitespace from 
            $_GET, $_POST & $_FILES

            linked (Sï¿½nia Cardoso)
14-08-03    Fixed problem where default lang from conf.ini was not being picked 
            up (Jeroen Laarhoven)
13-08-03    Members unassigned to groups can no longer log in

IMPROVEMENTS

23-09-03    Moved the DB::mysql::nextId mod, which allows all sequence IDs to be 
            stored in a single table, out into it's own class that overrides the 
            PEAR default functionality, making upgrades easier
23-09-03    Added ability to create 'static' pages which are hard-coded links to
            specific module elements, for example, individual articles.  So you 
            can create an article in Publisher->articles, then create a new tab 
            in Navigation Mgr and create a link directly to that article.  In 
            this case the 'static' box must be checked, and the article ID 
            passed in the 'additional params' field, eg, 'frmCatID=320'.  The 
            same approach can be taken to create a tab directly to a viewable or 
            downloadable document, FAQ item, whatver you like.
22-09-03    Upated following PEAR libs: Config, DB, DB_DataObject, HTTP_Header, 
            Log, Mail, Var_Dump, VFS, XML_Util
19-09-03    Thanks to Gilles Laborderie <gilles@users.sourceforge.net> for his

18-09-03    Combined Permissions module with Publisher to fit with simpler 
            modules logic
17-09-03    Admin view of framework simplified, now accomodates 'unlimited' 
            modules, still need some nice icons, suggestions welcomed :-)
15-09-03    SimpleTabView navigation tab generator replaced with simpler 
            and more powerful SimpleNav, no longer dependency on js links, 
            simple hrefs
14-09-03    Added the file /etc/debugIdeas.txt which includes some suggestions 
            targetted at less experienced programmers not familiar with 
            debugging techniques
12-09-03    Added improved error handling and debugging 
            (see http://www.phpkitchen.com/seagull/overview.htm#Debugging_&_Error_Handling)
02-09-03    Zipped downloads now a configurable option in Publisher 
            (Mario Izquierdo) 
02-09-03    Cleaned up init.php, config choices for user simplified
            (Jeroen Laarhoven)

            email/username duplicates for admins using User, now fixed
16-07-03    Fixed php 4.1+ dependency in session::_init() and isvalid()
16-07-03    Thanks to Jason Whittenburg <phpseagull@jasonwhittenburg.com> for
            pointing out that the user table can not be named 'user' as this
            is a reserved keyword in SQL92 standard and in MS SQL.  I've changed
            it to 'users' which resulted in a fair amount of knock-on changes.


IMPROVEMENTS
06-08-03    Moved "$process->requiresAuth = true" from start files to individual 
            class conf.ini files, making start files redundant; will allow for

06-08-03    Created Example module as basis for creating new modules
06-08-03    Made class naming scheme consistent, any class that inherits from

            PEAR::DB::nextId()
04-08-03    Removed all 't_name' prefixes, changed to more conventional 'table'
03-08-03    Renamed 'user_holding' table to 'contact', and former 'contact'
            table to 'contact_us' for clarity
01-08-03    Pass optional true boolean parameter to SGL::getTime() to get gmt 
            timestamp instead of localised one
01-08-03    Failed DB connections properly caught, finally ;-)

            Session::get('uid')
28-07-03    Moved majority of config settings from init.php to /etc/conf.ini
16-07-03    Cleaned up inheritance tree, all methods in Base now static, no
            longer necessary to inherit from Base
16-07-03    Text strings moved out to translation file for header, footer,
            Home, Login, Register, Contact Us
16-07-03    Removed Manager::hasAccess which duplicated

03-07-03    Modified Output::generateSelect() to be able to correctly accept 
            arrays for the selected param, in other words, so your multi-select 
            lists can have multiple items pre-selected.  No bc break, 
            additional third param indicates if select is multiple
03-07-03    Fixed bug in CategoryManager where getBreadCrumbs() class var had 
            to be unset in order not to produce errors for multilpe calls


IMPROVEMENTS
