Obtaining Seagull
-----------------

Further information and the latest release can be obtained at

http://seagull.phpkitchen.com


Requirements
------------

Running Seagull requires no extra extensions or configuration options, just
the following or greater:

PHP     4.1.x
MySQL   3.23.x
Apache  1.3.x

NOTE: Apache 2.x will probably work but is not recommended, same is true
    for the PHP 4.4.x branch though previous and later version are fine. Also,
    MySQL 4.1 branch can be difficult to get to work with PHP's mysql client libs,
    therefore 4.0.x is recommended.
